Background: there is a web serial/novel called The Wandering Inn. This serial is in the genre LitRPG, and characters gain classes, levels, and skills much like a role playing game. It's one of the longest pieces of fiction, and it has a large cast, so it can be hard to remember exactly what skills a given character has at a given point.



Note that the series is mostly pretty consistent, but there might be times where it fails to be perfectly consistent with what a skill is named or something.



Characters can have multiple classes, and they can gain multiple levels at once, though it will simply skip reporting the in-between levels (i.e. a character may go from level 4 to level 6, but the notification will just be for obtaining level 6). Classes also evolve, and can consolidate multiple classes into one.



There are no set in stone rules for what skills characters may get at given levels, and classes tend to be unique at higher levels (past about level 20). Skills and spells are basically treated the same, though they are reported as Skill vs Spell.

Characters can gain skills and spells without leveling (through simply learning the skill or spell manually), though it's uncommon.



There is special formatting for when a character gains a class, level, skill, or spell, it always surrounds those events in brackets, like:

\[{CLASS NAME HERE} class obtained!]

\[{CLASS NAME HERE} level {NEW LEVEL HERE}]

\[Skill - {SKILL NAME HERE} obtained!]

\[Spell - {SPELL NAME HERE} obtained!]



For example:

\[Innkeeper class obtained!]

\[Magical innkeeper level 40!]

\[Skill – Inn: Garden of Sanctuary obtained!]

\[Spell - Fireball obtained!]



I want to build an app that scrapes through the entire web serial in order, chapter by chapter, and compiles a list that I can parse through to select what character a given class/skill/etc notification applies to, and stores that information by chapter and by level, so that I can later use the app to look up, for example all the known skills a given character has at a given level. This way I don't risk spoilers of skills or level changes by going to the wiki.



Basically, this is intended to be a smarter wiki/encyclopedia of classes and skills for people reading who aren't fully caught up, or who want to check when a character obtained a given skill, that kind of thing.



Eventually I may extend this to be useable for other LitRPG series, since that's a popular genre right now, and this is a problem I've run into multiple times.
